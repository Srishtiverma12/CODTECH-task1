OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT:BACKGROUND REMOVER FLASK APP USING PYTHON

OBJECTIVE:

COMPUTER VISION:Computer Vision is a subfield of AI that enables machines to interpret
and understand visual information from the real world. This task involves
working on a computer vision problem, such as image classification or
object detection,remover.

HISTORY OF COMPUTER VISION:
The history of computer vision
Computer vision feels like a new invention, but today's version is actually the culmination of decades of work. It began in earnest at MIT in the mid-1960s, under the purview of “Project MAC,” short for Project on Mathematics and Computation


KEY ACTIVITIES FOR COMPUTER VISION

1.Define the Problem and Objectives

2.Data Collection and Preparation

Data cleaning

Data annotation

Data Preprocessing

3.EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)

4.Model Selection

5.Model Selection

6.Model Evaluation

7.Model Improvement

8.Deployment

9.Documentation and Reporting

Documentation: Document the entire process, including data sources, model architecture, training procedures, and evaluation results

Reporting: Prepare reports and presentations to communicate findings and results to stakeholders

10.Ethical and Legal Considerations

Data Privacy: Ensure that data collection and usage comply with privacy laws and regulations.

Bias and Fairness: Assess and mitigate any biases in the data and model to ensure fairness.

KEY INSIGHTS OF THE PROJECT (BACKGROUND REMOVER FLASK APP USING PYTHON)

1.Setting Up the Environment
pip install Flask opencv-python pillow numpy

2.Designing the Project Structure

3.Building the Flask Application
Initialize Flask App: Create the main application file (app.py)

4.Implementing Background Removal Logic
Develop Image Processing Function: Implement the logic to remove the background from the uploaded image

5.Creating the Frontend
Design HTML Template: Create a simple frontend to upload images.

6.Testing and Debugging
Run the App: Start the Flask server and test the application.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

PYTHON

FLASK
Flask is a micro-framework that allows us to build web applications using Python. It is lightweight and provides an easy-to-use interface for building web applications.

PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Python Imaging Library is a free and open-source additional library for the Python programming language that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

rembg (Python library that removes background)
Rembg is an open-source Python library designed specifically for removing image backgrounds.

CONCLUSION

We used the Flask micro-framework, Python Imaging Library (PIL), and rembg to process the images. By following these steps, you can build your own Flask app for removing the background of any image.
